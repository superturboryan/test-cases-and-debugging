/*
Make this function return the input string wrapped to 40 characters per line. 
This means you'll have to insert a newline \n character after every 40 characters in the input string. 
If the next character after a cut is a space, then do not display it. 

For example with the input:

Lorem ipsumos dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni quisquam

the output would be:

Lorem ipsumos dolor sit amet consectetur
adipisicing elit. Magni quisquam

instead of:

Lorem ipsumos dolor sit amet consectetur
 adipisicing elit. Magni quisquam

even though there is a space before the a in adipisicing
